Here are some ideas:

1)
    a) Single-cell experiment
    Create cells
    Create Poisson noise spike trains
    Connect and find parameters (w_exc_noise, w_inh_noise, f_exc_noise, f_inh_noise) so that the neuron fires with an output rate of a 0.2 - 2 Hz

    Learning outcomes:
        - some nest basics
        - extracting recorded data, plotting membrane potentials and raster plots
        - simple analysis

    b) Parameter storage

    Learning outcomes:
        - Use simulation_parameters to store and retrieve parameters
        - parameter sweeps


2)  
    a) Connect one cell to the other in a feed-forward manner
    b) Use some plasticity model (STDP) to modify the weights based on their spiking patterns
    c) Install the BCPNN module and repeat

    Learning outcomes:
        - get a feeling for the weights between neurons
        - learn how to retrieve weights from NEST
        - plot the weight development depending on e.g. mean input/output spike distance


3)  Create populations of cells and explore the dynamics of a modular network consisting of several subpopulations.
    A minicolumn is a small subpopulation of neurons that receive shared input.
    Several minicolumns connect a common pool of inhibitory neurons which in turn provide inhibitory feedback to all minicolumns.

    a) Set up the connectivity for one 'hypercolumn' (also called macro-column or a network motif)
    b) Find parameters for w_exc_inh and w_inh_exc
